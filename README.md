# meteor-dapp-timestamp

The web UI for interacting with the DATA timestamp contracts on Ethereum, built using the meteor framework.

## Run Locally
Get meteor and install it
```
curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
```



Download this repository somewhere locally, and open a terminal/cmd prompt within the folder and run
```
meteor
```
The page should build and then be served locally at http://localhost:3000 and you should have the same functionality as with http://test.ethapp.io/
